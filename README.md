This is a starter app / boilerplate for any type of SPA application that you'd want to build with VueJS. If you use, say, Laravel / [laravel-api-boilerplate-jwt](https://github.com/francescomalatesta/laravel-api-boilerplate-jwt) (a package by # [francescomalatesta](https://github.com/francescomalatesta)), you'll feel right at home as it integrates with it's API Auth functions.

## vue-cli 3
For scaffolding of this app, [vue-cli 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) has been used, meaning, you get to use latest vue-cli 3 features, like [plugins](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/plugins-and-presets.html#plugins).

## UIkit
It would seem that [UIkit CSS framework](https://getuikit.com/) doesn't get as much attention as it deserves. I believe it's one of the most complete frameworks out there, fun to use, awesome when you master it. This boilerplate is built with UIKit, but you don't need to use it if you don't want to. Login and Register pages are self-contained, and contain their own style, just for this reason.

#### If you want to change and use Bootstrap:
```
npm remove uikit --save
npm install bootstrap --save
```
Also don't forget to cleanup `main.js` file.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

  

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

  

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

  

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```
### Run your unit tests
*Tests are not really written, but you can use Jest built-in into this boilerplate. Pull requests are welcome, as well. :)*
```
npm run test:unit
```
### Additional settings
Please visit /src/settings.js and change the params there to suite your app. It's kinda important since `API_SERVER` will be used to contact Auth functions of your API.
```
APP_NAME:  "Pure Awesomeness",
API_SERVER:  "http://192.168.10.10/api/"
```
### File structure
This is pretty much the default file structure that you get from scaffolding app from `vue-cli 3`, added stuff to suit the needs of the boilerplate.
